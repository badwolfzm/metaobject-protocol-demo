# MetaObject Protocol & DSL API Framework

A universal, extensible platform for defining, introspecting, and calling APIs using meta-objects and a simple domain-specific language (DSL).

> **Write APIs and data objects in a single DSL file, expose them instantly as endpoints, and use a browser playground to test, introspect, and round-trip object data.**

---

## üöÄ What is This?

MetaObject Protocol & DSL API Framework is a minimal but powerful toolkit for:

- Defining APIs and meta-objects with a single, readable DSL (`routes.dsl`)
- Exposing endpoints automatically (GET/POST with any parameters or objects)
- Serializing, sending, and reconstructing complex objects between browser and server
- Introspecting object structure and field values dynamically
- Building auto-documenting, schema-driven applications with zero lock-in

It works with **vanilla PHP and JavaScript**‚Äîno frameworks, no bloat, 100% open source.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `main.html` (or `index.html`): Interactive web client playground and API tester  
- `MetaCompiler.php`: The universal meta-object engine and DSL runtime (backend)
- `routes.dsl`: Your API and object definitions in a human-friendly DSL
- `index.php` (or `router.php`): The router/server entry point
- `README.md`: (this file!)
- `LICENSE`: MIT license file

---

## üî• Quick Demo

### 1. Clone this repo and put it on a PHP server

### 2. Open `main.html` in your browser  
You‚Äôll see a DSL editor and API tester.

### 3. Try This DSL:

```dsl
let hello = (name) => "Hello, " . $name;
tag hello as api, get, path:/api_v1/hello;

let add = (a, b) => $a + $b;
tag add as api, post, path:/api_v1/add;

let greet_person = (person) => {
    $obj = $person->get();
    $name = $obj->get("name");
    $age = $obj->get("age");
    return [ "greeting" => "Hello $name, age $age" ];
};
tag greet_person as api, post, path:/api_v1/greet_person;
````

### 4. Call the endpoints!

* `/index.php?path=/api_v1/hello&name=Alice` ‚Üí `Hello, Alice`
* POST to `/index.php?path=/api_v1/add` with `{ "a": 2, "b": 3 }` ‚Üí `5`
* POST to `/index.php?path=/api_v1/greet_person` with `{ "person": { "name": "Alice", "age": 30 } }` ‚Üí `Hello Alice, age 30`

## üß© How to Write `routes.dsl`

* **Define a function:**
  `let name = (param1, param2) => { ... };`

* **Expose as API:**
  `tag name as api, get, path:/api_v1/name;`
  or
  `tag name as api, post, path:/api_v1/name;`

* **Handle objects:**
  The argument will be a `MetaVar` (with its value a `MetaObject`).
  Use `$obj = $param->get(); $obj->get("field")` to access fields.

* **Return values or arrays:**
  Anything returned will be JSON-encoded for the client.

#### **Example:**

```dsl
let register = (user) => {
    $obj = $user->get();
    $username = $obj->get("username");
    $email = $obj->get("email");
    return [ "registered" => true, "user" => $username, "email" => $email ];
};
tag register as api, post, path:/api_v1/register;
```

## üñ•Ô∏è How Does the API Router Work?

1. Loads all DSL/API definitions using `MetaCompiler.php`
2. Receives HTTP requests (GET/POST) at `/index.php?path=<route>`
3. Finds the matching endpoint
4. Maps parameters/objects to MetaVars/MetaObjects
5. Calls your DSL function
6. Returns structured JSON, including meta-object descriptions

---

## üåê How Does the Client Work?

* Reads/parses your DSL, discovers all APIs
* Lets you fill out and submit arguments for each API
* Sends the request, displays JSON response and **reconstructed object**
* You can edit, resubmit, or auto-generate forms based on the introspected schema

---

## üí° Advanced Usage

* Supports **nested/recursive objects** (objects as fields)
* Objects can be described, introspected, and mutated live in JS or PHP
* Easy to extend: add permissions, validation, plugins, etc.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Contributing

* Fork the repo, open issues/PRs!
* Improve docs, add examples, or port to other languages.
* Discuss new features in the Issues tab.

## üìù Appendix: Example DSL Snippets

**Simple GET:**

```dsl
let ping = () => "pong";
tag ping as api, get, path:/api_v1/ping;
```

**POST with array:**

```dsl
let sum = (x, y) => $x + $y;
tag sum as api, post, path:/api_v1/sum;
```

**POST with object:**

```dsl
let register = (user) => {
    $u = $user->get();
    return [ "username" => $u->get("username") ];
};
tag register as api, post, path:/api_v1/register;
```
